Created minimal design doc. Also created fetch(symbol, interval) command as per measley design doc, but as
of right now the fetch command pretty prints the data, but returns it in a very ugly and difficult fashion.
Will use either OOP and toString functionality to fix this, or, more likely, create a data structure that is
passed around (dictionary by timestamp of tuples. Each tuple has two values: high, and low)

Created the PriceData class, pretty convenient. Made appropriate changes to the design doc. Now, price data is retrieved as part of this object, and this data is recieved immediately upon instantiation.

Restructured the proj a bit. Turns out there already exists an officially supported alpaca python SDK, so Im gonna use that. alpaca.py is in the deprec/ (deprecated) directory now. new file:requirements.txt in doc/, since the SDK, and its depencancies, need to be installed. All changes reflected in the design doc.
